## About
This is a template file for people to generate their page for HullNet. Open this file in a plain text editor such as notepad or in a markdown editor. Make sure this file is saved with the extension`.md`. This paragraph should be replaced with a short description of your work or elements of your research bio in general. The only mandatory parts is the section above with the name and tags. Everything else is just a normal markdown document to do with what you will. I have just typed out a skeleton to help guide people. 

The tag section above should list at least 3 tags. One should be your academic status "academic" is fine if you want to be more specific "academic/pi" or "academic/postdoc". If you are a phd student then "academic/phd". The second tag should be your discipline feel free to put whatever you like however try to match an established area. i.e biology, chemistry, physics, sociology, psychology etc. The third tag should be your sub discipline here you may be as specific as you like. If you feel you span multiple sub disciplines or disciplines please add more tags but do not exceed a depth of two. For example Dr Template could also be "chemistry" and "chemistry/organic" but cannot be "chemistry/organic/peptidoglycan-synthesis". Multiword tags should use a dash to separate and no words should be capitalised. 

## Research Projects

### Project 1
